# Enigma Re-creation

Over the last several years, I've been involved in generating 3D models of the [Enigma I](https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/i/index.htm). I've written a few [blog posts](http://www.marius.org/tag/enigma/) about the topic and through the course of writing information about it, several people have independently contacted me.

Several people have asked for copies of my Fusion 360 files, and I've decided it would be great to make a github repo and project for people to collaborate on this effort. We're working on formalizing how we can better collaborate with members of the community, and this will include periodic publication of Fusion360 files in a distributable format into this repository.
